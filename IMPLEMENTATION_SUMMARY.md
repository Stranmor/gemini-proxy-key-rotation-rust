# Model-Specific Key Blocking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented model-specific key blocking for 429 (quota exceeded) errors in the Gemini API proxy. The system now tracks quota exhaustion per model per key, allowing keys to remain active for models that still have quota while blocking them only for models that have exceeded their limits.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Model-Specific Key State Management
- **Enhanced KeyState Structure**: Added `model_blocks` field to track blocking per model
- **ModelBlockState**: New structure to store blocking information with expiration time and reason
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Keys are automatically unblocked at quota reset time (00:00 PST / 10:00 MSK)

### 2. Intelligent Key Selection
- **Model-Aware Key Rotation**: `get_next_available_key_info_for_model()` method selects keys based on model availability
- **Request Model Extraction**: Automatically extracts model names from request paths and bodies
- **Unified Rotation Strategy**: Single rotation mechanism that considers model-specific blocks

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **429 Error Processing**: Distinguishes between general rate limiting and model-specific quota exhaustion
- **Model-Specific Blocking**: `mark_key_as_limited_for_model()` blocks keys only for specific models
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing general key blocking for non-model-specific errors

### 4. Admin Dashboard Enhancements
- **Model Statistics Endpoint**: New `/admin/model-stats` endpoint provides real-time blocking statistics
- **Enhanced Key Information**: Key details now include model-specific blocking information
- **Visual Dashboard Updates**: Added model-specific blocking section to the HTML dashboard

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Full test coverage for model-specific blocking functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Verified compatibility with existing functionality
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests for expired blocks, cleanup, and statistics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Changes
1. **src/key_manager.rs**: Enhanced with model-specific blocking logic
2. **src/handler.rs**: Updated to extract models and use model-aware key selection
3. **src/admin.rs**: Added model statistics endpoint and enhanced key information
4. **static/dashboard.html**: Added model-specific blocking visualization
5. **static/style.css**: Added styling for new UI components

### Key Methods Added
- `is_key_available_for_model()`: Checks key availability for specific models
- `mark_key_as_limited_for_model()`: Blocks keys for specific models
- `cleanup_expired_model_blocks()`: Removes expired model blocks
- `get_model_block_stats()`: Provides blocking statistics
- `get_blocked_models_info()`: Returns detailed blocking information

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct ModelBlockState {
    pub blocked_until: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub reason: String,
}

pub struct KeyState {
    pub status: KeyStatus,
    pub reset_time: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub model_blocks: HashMap<String, ModelBlockState>,
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Quota Utilization
- Keys blocked for one model (e.g., gemini-pro) can still serve other models (e.g., gemini-flash)
- Maximizes available quota across all models
- Reduces unnecessary key blocking

### 2. Better User Experience
- More requests succeed as keys remain available for non-exhausted models
- Clear error messages when models are unavailable
- Transparent quota reset timing

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- Real-time visibility into model-specific blocking status
- Detailed statistics for capacity planning
- Historical tracking of quota usage patterns

### 4. Operational Excellence
- Automatic cleanup of expired blocks
- Persistent state management
- Backward compatibility with existing configurations

## Usage Examples

### Model-Specific Blocking
When a 429 error occurs for `gemini-pro`, only that model is blocked for the specific key:
```
Key1: ✅ Available for gemini-flash, ❌ Blocked for gemini-pro
Key2: ✅ Available for both models
```

### Admin Dashboard
- View blocked models with reset times
- Monitor key status per model
- Track quota utilization patterns

### API Integration
- Automatic model extraction from request paths
- Seamless integration with existing proxy functionality
- No changes required to client applications

## Future Enhancements
- Model-specific quota monitoring
- Predictive quota management
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Custom blocking policies per model

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully addresses all requirements while maintaining system stability and backward compatibility. The solution provides intelligent quota management that maximizes API availability and improves overall system efficiency.
