# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Gemini Proxy Key Rotation project.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 游댮 API Key Leakage in Logs (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Full API keys were being logged in error messages, potentially exposing sensitive credentials in log files.

**Fix**: 
- Replaced all instances of full key logging with `KeyManager::preview_key()` function
- Only first 4 and last 4 characters are now logged (e.g., "sk-1234...cdef")
- Affected files: `src/handlers/mod.rs`

**Impact**: Prevents credential exposure in logs, monitoring systems, and error tracking.

### 游리 Timing Attack Vulnerability in Authentication
**Issue**: Admin token and CSRF token comparisons used standard string equality (`==`), making them vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Fix**:
- Implemented constant-time string comparison function `secure_compare()`
- Applied to both admin authentication and CSRF token validation
- Affected files: `src/middleware/admin_auth.rs`, `src/admin.rs`

**Impact**: Prevents timing-based attacks on authentication tokens.

### 游리 Redis KEYS Command in Production
**Issue**: Used Redis `KEYS` command which blocks the entire Redis server and can cause performance issues.

**Fix**:
- Added safety check to only use `KEYS` command in test environments
- Added warning for production environments
- Affected files: `src/key_manager.rs`

**Impact**: Prevents Redis performance degradation in production.

### 游리 Request Size DoS Vulnerability
**Issue**: No limits on incoming request body size, allowing potential DoS attacks through large requests.

**Fix**:
- Added `request_size_limit_middleware` with 10MB limit
- Only applies to POST/PUT/PATCH methods
- Returns 413 Payload Too Large for oversized requests
- Affected files: `src/middleware/request_size_limit.rs`, `src/lib.rs`

**Impact**: Prevents memory exhaustion attacks through large request bodies.

### 游리 CSRF Token Size Validation
**Issue**: CSRF tokens could be arbitrarily large, potentially causing DoS.

**Fix**:
- Added 128-character limit for CSRF tokens
- Rejects oversized tokens as invalid
- Affected files: `src/admin.rs`

**Impact**: Prevents DoS attacks through oversized CSRF tokens.

### 游리 Memory Leak in Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Rate limiting store never cleaned up old entries, causing gradual memory leak.

**Fix**:
- Added periodic cleanup of entries older than 2 window durations
- Prevents unbounded memory growth
- Affected files: `src/middleware/rate_limit.rs`

**Impact**: Prevents memory exhaustion over time.

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Secure Logging**: All sensitive data (API keys, tokens) are now properly masked in logs
2. **Constant-Time Comparisons**: All authentication-related comparisons use timing-safe functions
3. **Resource Limits**: Request size limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
4. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks in long-running services
5. **Production Safety**: Dangerous operations (like Redis KEYS) are restricted to test environments

## Recommendations for Further Security Improvements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing more sophisticated rate limiting (per-user, per-endpoint)
2. **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints
3. **Audit Logging**: Implement detailed audit logging for admin operations
4. **TLS Configuration**: Ensure proper TLS configuration in production
5. **Secret Management**: Consider using dedicated secret management systems for API keys
6. **Security Headers**: Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.) to HTTP responses

## Security Testing

All security fixes have been validated with:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- Performance tests to ensure no regression

Run the test suite with:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers rather than opening a public issue.
